# Dendrometric-Analysis-and-Simulation
This project analyzes tree height-diameter relationships using a Gompertz model, estimates biomass with an allometric equation, and calculates forest carbon stock. It includes model evaluation using RMSE, AIC, and residual analysis.
# Forest Biomass Analysis

This repository contains a Kaggle Notebook that analyzes tree height-diameter allometry and estimates forest biomass and carbon stock using a Gompertz model and allometric equations.

## Files
- **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis.
- **Donnes du PNKB.csv**: Dataset used in the analysis.
- **README.md**: This short project description.

## Overview
The notebook fits a Gompertz model to the observed data, estimates biomass with an allometric equation (using wood density), and calculates carbon stock (assumed as 50% of biomass). The results are visualized and evaluated with metrics like RMSE and AIC.
